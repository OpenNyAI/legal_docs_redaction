# Legal Documents Redaction
This repository is for offline semi-automatic data redaction of legal documents by masking named entities identified using Machine Learning. The output of redaction using this code needs to be reviewed by humans to make sure all the sensitive information is masked.


#  1. About Legal Documents Redaction
## Why offline data redaction?
Many a times the legal documents cant be shared outside the organization, even to cloud service providers. So this repository puts the open source AI models togehter in a docker image which can run offline within an organization.

## What is Redaction and why is it important to do this semi-automatically?
Redaction is the process of removing sensitive information from a document. It is important to redact documents to protect sensitive information from being exposed. Sensitive information includes, but is not limited to, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), and financial information.
Doing the redaction manually is time consuming and error prone. This repository provides a semi-automatic way of redacting documents. Since automatic redaction cant remove all the sensitive information, it is important to review the redacted documents to make sure all the sensitive information is masked.

## What information is automatically redacted using this repository?
Information to be redacted is handled in two ways: Masking and Dummy Replacement. In masking, sensitive information is replaced with "XXXX". In dummy replacement, the sensitive information is replaced with dummy information. For example, a company name "Apple Inc." can be replaced with "ORG1" etc. All the company names that are very similar e.g. "Apple" are also replaced with "ORG1".

Following entities in the input documents are identified and redacted using this repository:

| Redaction Type    | Entity Types                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Masking           | "DATE", "MONEY", "PERCENT", "QUANTITY", "TIME" |
| Dummy Replacement | "ORG", "PERSON", "PRODUCT"                     |

E.g. Input sentence: "Vodafone is engaged in the business of providing Unified Access Services from 1st April 2020 to 31 March 2021 at cost of Rs. 5Cr."
Redacted sentence: "ORG1 is engaged in the business of providing Unified Access Services from XXXXX to XXXXX at cost of Rs. XXXXX."

## What file formats are supported?
Currently, PDF, DOC and DOCX files are supported. All the files are converted to DOCX files before processing.
PDF files can be either scanned or digitally readable. It is recommended to have digitally readable PDFs. For scanned PDF files, the table structures are lost and hence the output might not be as expected. For digitally readable PDF files, the table structures are retained.

## What languages are supported?
Currently only English language is supported.

# üîß 2. Installation
## 2.1 Recommended Hardware
It is required to use a machine with at least 6GB RAM and 4 cores. Having more RAM and cores will help in faster processing of the documents. 
## 2.1 Windows Installation
- Check if virtualization is enabled. [help](https://youtu.be/X2fKuPS3yIM) 
- If not, enable it from BIOS. [help1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1), [help2](https://www.simplilearn.com/enable-virtualization-windows-10-article)
- Install WSL. Run following command in Command Prompt as Administrator:
```bash
wsl --install
```
- Change the resouce allocation for WSL to 4GB RAM and 2 cores. Feel free to add more resources if you have them. Run following command in Command Prompt as Administrator: 
```bash
type > %UserProfile%/.wslconfig
```
Open this file and put following contents in the file:
```
[wsl2]
memory=4GB
processors=4
```

- Install [podman](https://podman.io/)
- start podman service.
- Pull the docker image (7.5GB). Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run the following command:
```bash
podman pull docker.io/opennyaiofficial/legal_docs_redaction:latest_intel
```

## 2.2 Mac & Linux Installation
- Install [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) using Homebrew. ```brew install colima```
- Run the following command:
```bash
colima start --cpu 4 --memory 6G
```
- If you have Mac with M1 chip then ,Open Terminal and run the following command:
```bash
docker pull opennyaiofficial/legal_docs_redaction:latest_mac
```
- Else if you have Mac with Intel chip then ,Open Terminal and run the following command: 
```bash
docker pull opennyaiofficial/legal_docs_redaction:latest_intel
```

# üë©‚Äçüíª 3. Usage
Put all the files to be redacted in a folder. Create an empty folder where all the redacted files will be put.
Run the following command in Command Prompt or Terminal. Replace the input and output paths with the actual paths.
## 3.1 Windows or Linux or Intel Mac Usage
```bash
 podman run -v <input_folder_path>:/data/input -v <output_folder_path>:/data/output --rm opennyaiofficial/legal_docs_redaction:latest_intel
 ```

## 3.1 Mac with M1 chip Usage
```bash
docker run -v <input_folder_path>:/data/input -v <output_folder_path>:/data/output --rm opennyaiofficial/legal_docs_redaction:latest_mac
```

# üìù 4. Output
Grab a coffee till the redaction is processing. Once it completes, you will see the redacted DOCX files in the output folder. The redacted files will have the same name as the input files.
The output files can be opened in Microsoft Word and reviewed. You will also notice that there are csv files which 

# 5. FAQs
### 5.1 Is my data safe? Are the contents of my documents sent to cloud?
The entire redaction process happens on the machine where you install this tool. No data is sent outside the machine.

### 5.2 Why is the redaction slow?
The speed of redaction can be slow for scanned PDFs as OCR needs to be performed. Also, try giving more resources to the docker image. Refer to the installation section for more details.

### 5.3 Some files are missing in the output which are present in input folder
There can be errors while processing some files. Please share these with Opennyai team to see if we can find a fix for these.

### 5.4 Formatting of the input files is lost in the output files
Yes is this is the current implementation.

### 5.5 How to add more entities to be redacted?
Please share your requirements with Opennyai team and we will try to add them in the next release.

### 5.6 Some entities are not redacted
We use spacy models to identify entities and mask them. Spacy models can miss some entities. If you observe a pattern, please contact OpenNyAI team.

### 5.7 May I add pattern based redaction?
Currently this is not implemented. Please share your requirements with Opennyai team and we will try to add them in the next release.
